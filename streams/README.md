# Reactive Programming.
### is a programming with asynchronous data streams.

## Data Streams
### is an objects that emits multiple pieces of data over time.

## Future
### A Future represents a computation that doesn't complete immediately. 
### Where a normal function returns the results, an asynchronous function returns a Future
### Which will eventually contain the result. 
### The Future will tell you when the results is ready.

## Stream
### A Stream is sequence of asynchronous events. 
### It is like an asynchronous Iterable - where, 
### Instead of get the next event when you ask for it.
### The stream tells you that there is an event when it is ready.
